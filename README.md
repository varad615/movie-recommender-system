# Movie Recommender System (TMDB Dataset)

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System (TMDB Dataset) is a content-based recommendation system implemented using cosine similarity. This system aims to provide movie recommendations to users based on the similarity of movie attributes. The recommender system utilizes the TMDB dataset, which contains comprehensive information about movies, including genres, cast, crew, and user ratings.

## Features
- Content-Based Recommendation: The system recommends movies to users based on the similarity of movie attributes, such as genres, cast, and crew.
- Cosine Similarity: The system uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies, allowing it to provide accurate and relevant recommendations.
- TMDB Dataset Integration: The system utilizes the TMDB dataset, which provides a rich collection of movie information, including genres, cast, crew, and ratings.

## Installation and Setup
To run the Movie Recommender System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the Movie Recommender System repository from GitHub.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook on your system.
3. Install the necessary Python libraries and dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`recommender.ipynb`) and run each cell sequentially.

## Usage
Using the Movie Recommender System is straightforward:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`recommender.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and build the recommender system.
3. Once the system is built, you can input a movie title to get a list of recommended movies based on similarity.
4. The system will provide a list of recommended movies based on cosine similarity scores, ensuring that the recommendations are closely related to the input movie.

## Dataset
The Movie Recommender System utilizes the TMDB dataset. You can download the dataset from [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or from the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Ensure that you have the necessary dataset files and provide the correct file paths in the Jupyter Notebook.
